# Improvement

This project aims to track my personal improvements each week. By making one small change each week, I hope to make a large change over time.

# Week 1 - Tasking
## 3/10 - 3/16
### Motivation

I think keeping a strong tasking system is the foundation for a reliable overall workflow in life. Tasking has two main components - tasks and timing. Tasks are obviously important for keeping track of what needs to get done next. For me, timing helps me focus on what needs to be done at the current moment and not get distracted by other things.

### Tools
#### Todoist

I'll be using Todoist to keep track of all my tasks.

#### Clockify

I'll be using clockify with it's Todoist integration to time all my tasks.

### Rules

- All school-related and learning-related work goes into Todoist
- Any time spend > 10 minutes on a task must be tracked with Clockify
- Check Todoist each morning before class and each night before bed
- Reach Todoist Zero each night
