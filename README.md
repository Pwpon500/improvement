# Improvement

This project aims to track my personal improvements each week. By making one small change each week, I hope to make a large change over time.

# Week 1 - Tasking
## 3/10 - 3/16
### Motivation

I think keeping a strong tasking system is the foundation for a reliable overall workflow in life. Tasking has two main components - tasks and timing. Tasks are obviously important for keeping track of what needs to get done next. For me, timing helps me focus on what needs to be done at the current moment and not get distracted by other things.

### Tools
#### Todoist

I'll be using Todoist to keep track of all my tasks.

#### Clockify

I'll be using clockify with its Todoist integration to time all my tasks.

### Rules

- All school-related and learning-related work goes into Todoist
- Any time spend > 10 minutes on a task must be tracked with Clockify
- Check Todoist each morning before class and each night before bed
- Reach Todoist Zero each night

# Week 2 - Workouts
## 3/17 - 3/23
### Reflection

This week was overall good, but I didn't hold up to some of what I wanted to do. I didn't check Todoist in the morning, and the time tracking didn't help keep me on task like I thought it would. That said, I got to Todoist zero every night, and I was very good about putting my tasks into Todoist. I also switched from Clockify to Forest halfway through, and that helped immensely. Forest makes me actually put down my phone and not go to distracting websites, which was fantastic.

I will continue to use Todoist and Forest in conjunction.

### Motivation

With living a busy life come many excuses to not work out, but I need to work harder to work out more. Working out measurable improve cognitive function and overall happiness.
